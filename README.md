# xrpl-gpc-token

This repository contains the project for issuing and building the ecosystem of the Gold Pegged Coin (GPC), a gold-backed token based on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The Creder team aims to leverage XRPL's native functionalities to launch GPC as a stable and transparent digital gold asset and establish its initial liquidity.

## Key Objectives:

- GPC Issuance and XRPL Mainnet Launch: Issue the GPC token on the XRPL mainnet, backed 1:1 by physical gold reserves.

- Leveraging XRPL Native Features: Utilize XRPL's inherent primitives such as the Issued Token functionality, on-ledger DEX, Trust Lines, and Rippling Control to deploy GPC without the need for smart contracts.

- Xaman Wallet Compatibility: Ensure full integration with Xaman Wallet so users can securely hold and transact GPC.

- GPC Staking and RLUSD Reward System Implementation: Develop a platform where GPC holders can stake their tokens and earn rewards in RLUSD (Ripple's USD-pegged stablecoin), extending GPC's DeFi utility. (Utilizing a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture)

This project aims to present new possibilities for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization through XRPL's powerful features, promoting the utility and adoption of gold-backed assets within the XRPL ecosystem.
